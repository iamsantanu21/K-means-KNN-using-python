# K-means-and-KNN-using-python-from-scratch
Final year/semester major project on study machine learning and handling datasets using k-means and KNN algorithm and represent them on python from scratch.
Hi, I am Santanu Mondal a computer science lover. I like to know how to machine do their job. 
let's talk about the code. If you have a little knowledge about python I think you will understand how it will work because we use to code it as simple as possible without using any package.
I think you will not get any kind of code in this manner anywhere else.
You can use this code without any hesitation.
If you need any help please feel free to contact me at iamsantanu21@gmail.com 
Thank you.
