Project Name: K-means and KNN Algorithms Implementation
This project implements two popular machine learning algorithms - K-means and KNN - in Python from scratch. The aim of this project is to understand the inner workings of these algorithms and how they can be used for clustering and classification tasks.

Features and Benefits
K-means algorithm: This algorithm can be used for clustering data points into groups based on their similarity. It is fast and scalable, making it suitable for large datasets. It can be used in applications such as customer segmentation, market analysis, and image segmentation.

KNN algorithm: This algorithm can be used for classification tasks by identifying the K nearest neighbors to a new data point and using their labels to make a prediction. It is simple and easy to understand, making it a good choice for beginners. It can be used in applications such as spam filtering, handwriting recognition, and recommender systems.

Installation and Usage
To use this project, you'll need to have Python 3.x installed on your system. You can download the code from the GitHub repository and run it from the command line. The following libraries are required:
NumPy
Pandas
Matplotlib
Scikit-learn

You can install these libraries using pip: pip install numpy pandas matplotlib scikit-learn

Once you have the required libraries installed, you can run the K-means and KNN algorithms by running the kmeans.py and knn.py scripts respectively.
